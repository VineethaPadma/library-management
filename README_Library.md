# 📖 Library Management System (C++)

A basic **Library Management System** built using **C++**, designed to handle core operations like adding, displaying, searching, and deleting book records. The application uses file handling for persistent data storage.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new books to the library
- Display all books in the system
- Search for books by ID or title
- Delete a book from the library
- File-based data persistence

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- File Handling (fstream)

## 📁 File Structure

- `main.cpp` – Contains the core logic for the library management system
- `library.txt` – Stores the book records persistently

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VineethaPadma/library-management.git
   ```
2. Open the project in any C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, VS Code).
3. Compile the `main.cpp` file:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o LibraryApp
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./LibraryApp
   ```

## 📌 Use Cases

- Academic learning project for understanding file I/O in C++
- Mini-project for college coursework or assignments
- A starter project for beginners to practice OOP and C++ basics
